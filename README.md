# NongManager
## A simple nong installer for Linux, Windows, and MacOS

## _Installation:_

## Linux
Download source code and run.  
You will need to supply an alternate Geometry Dash AppData folder.  
This is the platform I use (as an arch user) so this will be the most tested version
## Windows
I do not own a Windows computer, so all testing will be done via  
a friend's computer. Expect more bugs.  
You can find executable in the releases tab or can download and run  
the source for a more updated version.
## MacOS
I do not have any access to an Apple computer, so all support is theoretical.  
While it _should_ work on MacOS with an alternate Geometry Dash AppData folder  
when run from source, there will be no support for this version.

## _Trouble Shooting_
Under construction... Come back later :)  
For now just report the issue and I will see how I can help.
